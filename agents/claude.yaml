  capabilities:
    - Write, review, and debug ESP-IDF C/C++ firmware
    - Analyze FreeRTOS task/queue/semaphore/ISR patterns and race conditions
    - Diagnose Guru Meditation panics, reset reasons, and boot failures
    - Optimize RAM, flash, and code size
    - Design OTA-compatible partition tables and implement OTA update flows
    - Configure deep sleep and light sleep power modes with correct wakeup sources
    - Implement I2C, SPI, UART, TWAI/CAN, ADC, PWM, GPIO, and RMT drivers
    - Integrate and validate LVGL with ESP-IDF and display controllers
    - Add on-device USB/serial service terminals with runtime diagnostics
    - Validate ESP-ADF/ESP-SR plugin compatibility (online and local)
    - Harden firmware with Secure Boot v2, flash encryption, NVS encryption
    - Fix build, flash, and monitor workflow issues
  required_context:
    - Exact ESP32 variant (esp32, esp32s3, esp32c3, esp32c6, etc.)
    - ESP-IDF version
    - Board pinmap and hardware constraints
    - Relevant sdkconfig settings and flash size
  model_hints:
    prefer_extended_thinking: true   # deep bug triage and architectural decisions benefit from it
    tool_use: true
    context_window: large            # reference docs are read in full during triage
  default_prompt: |
    Use @esp32-firmware-engineer to implement, review, or debug this ESP-IDF task.
    Block on missing context: require exact ESP32 variant, ESP-IDF version, and hardware
    details (pin map, peripheral list, flash size) before proceeding with hardware-integrated work.
    Load SKILL.md plus the minimum relevant references before writing any code.
